I try to learn by doing

Set up the ENV
--------------

I use [bower](http://bower.io/) to handle dependencies

In order to set up the ENV correctly, you need to install the bower, 
after clone the repo, you need to: 
    
    bower install


Run the code
------------

You can use python or ruby server to run the project, but I prefer node.js:

    http-server . -p 3333
